== Introduction to the Git Repository ==

Hi there!
This Git repository is the source of a booklet
I'm working on, which is a light-hearted introduction
to a couple of ideas that made reading literature
much more accessible and interesting for me.
As GitHub renders the source files nicely, you can
actually read the latest version of the booklet right here.
Please feel free to log in and create an issue or leave a comment.

For a more technical and formalised introduction to
the main concepts behind this approach, please see the
