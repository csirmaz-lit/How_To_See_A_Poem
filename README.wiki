* [https://github.com/csirmaz-lit/How_To_See_A_Poem/wiki/Book-000-Contents A draft booklet] providing a light-hearted introduction to a couple of ideas from Representism that made reading literature much more accessible and interesting for me.
* [https://github.com/csirmaz-lit/How_To_See_A_Poem/wiki/Representism A wiki] explaining the central concepts in Representism.
