=Literature as a Bridge=

It's said often that literature (or, in fact, art in general) talks about things in an indirect way,
that what is meant is usually not what is actually said.
Of course baing an observant teenager who has spent his childhood in a post-socialist country
I suspected that George Orwell's <i>Animal Farm</i> wasn't really about pigs,
but considering that this could be true all the time, and using this as our starting point
will help tremendously in deciphering any poem or obscure story.

So how does this indirection work, and why is it there at all?
Any text, or painting, sign, sculpture, traffic light or musical note is some kind of communication,
and so literature is communication as well: the author says something, and the reader listens.
But what if there's an obstacle between them?
Imagine this a wide, swampy river, and the author and the reader stranded on its two sides.
If they cannot communicate directly, the sensible thing to do is to take a detour,
maybe upwards, in the form of a bridge.

The author, instead of saying what she means directly, will "translate" it before rendering it into
text, which can travel on top of the bridge to the reader, unhindered by the water.

The permise of this book is that this translation uses images.
